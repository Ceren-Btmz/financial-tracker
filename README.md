* Add Payments (Debits): Record your expenses by specifying the date, time, description, vendor, and payment amount.
* Ledger: View all your financial transactions, including both deposits and payments.
* Reports: Generate various financial reports based on different criteria, such as month-to-date, previous month, year-to-date, previous year, and vendor-based searches.

## How to Use:

1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Compile and run the 'FinancialTracker.java' file
3. Follow the on-screen instructions to navigate through the application:

6. **Data Storage:** The application stores your financial transactions in a file named transactions.csv. Ensure that this file is in the project directory and is not modified manually to avoid data corruption.

7. To exit the application, choose the "X" option from the main menu.   

## Dependencies:

* The Financial Tracker project has no external dependencies other than the standard Java libraries included with the JDK. Make sure you have a working Java environment (JDK) set up on your system.
* This project is built using Java and relies on the following libraries and classes:

  * 'java.io.*' for file input and output.
  * 'java.time.*' for handling date and time.
  * 'java.util.Scanner' for user input.
  * 'ArrayList<Transaction>' for managing a list of financial transactions.
  * 'DateTimeFormatter' for parsing and formatting date and time.
  
* Once you have followed these steps, you should be able to run the Financial Tracker and start managing your financial transactions.

## Special Feature:

This part of the code was very fun and entertaining to me because it was an area we had not fully covered. Creating a line of code that properly expressed the correct parameters felt like solving a math equation. This part of the code enhances the project because it reduces the need to have separate methods for each limitation of data.

## Future Work:


* User Authentication: Implement user accounts and authentication to ensure the privacy and security of financial data.
* Data Export: Allow users to export their transaction data in various formats (e.g., CSV, Excel) for reporting and analysis in other tools.
* Budgeting and Categories: Introduce the ability to categorize transactions and set up budgets to track spending in specific categories.
* Limited Error Handling: The project may have limited error handling in its current state. Enhancing error handling can provide more user-friendly feedback and prevent application crashes due to unexpected inputs.
* Date and Time Formats: The project assumes specific date and time formats. It could be enhanced to support more flexible date and time input formats.
